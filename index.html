            Hey, friends! I'm glad you found my website! My name is Crystal. I'm
            an Army veteran, an RVer (although no longer full-timing it), a
            makeup artist, and a skin care nerd! And soon to be a hairstylist! I
            live in South Carolina with my husband and our two dachshunds, Inara
            Cera and Kaylee Frye. We love doing outdoor activities followed by
            visiting gourmet eating and drinking establishments, because life is
            all about balance!
            <br />
            <br />
            But... what do I do? Why is this website here? I help women make
            money while on the go! I help women veterans discover their "follow
            on mission" in life after they hang up their uniform and take off
            their boots for the final time. I show them their new selves, selves
            they didn't know were in there. Let's connect if any of that sounds
            like you!
            <br />
            <br />
            I work with a company that keeps luxury products at an affordable
            price by growing their own ingredients and making their own
            products! We pass those savings to YOU as a customer!
            <br />
            <br />
            Last, but most certainly not least, I just love making new friends
            who are awesome people! Let's chat if that's you!
